# Dictionaries : Important Data Structure in Python and web development.
- # Dictionaries are mutable, unordered collections of key-value pairs.
    - They are defined using curly braces `{}` and can contain elements of different data types, including other dictionaries.
    -  Each key in a dictionary must be unique, and it is used to access the corresponding value.
    -  Values in a dictionary can be of any data type, including lists, tuples, and other dictionaries.
    -  Dictionaries are useful for storing and manipulating data that is associated with specific keys, such as configuration settings, user profiles, and more.
- # Example:
```python
my_dict = {
    "name": "John",
    "age": 30,
    "city": "New York"
}
print(my_dict["name"]) # Output: John
print(my_dict["age"]) # Output: 30
print(my_dict["city"]) # Output: New York
```
- # Adding a new key-value pair:
```python
my_dict["country"] = "USA"
print(my_dict["country"]) # Output: USA
```
- # Updating an existing key-value pair:
```python
my_dict["age"] = 31
print(my_dict["age"]) # Output: 31
```
- # Removing a key-value pair:
```python
del my_dict["city"]
print(my_dict) # Output: {'name': 'John', 'age': 31, 'country': 'USA'}
``` 
- # Checking if a key exists in the dictionary:
```python
if "name" in my_dict:
    print("Name exists in the dictionary")
else:
    print("Name does not exist in the dictionary")
```
- # Iterating through the keys and values of a dictionary:
```python
for key, value in my_dict.items():
    print(f"{key}: {value}") # Output: name: John, age: 31, country: USA
```
