# General Notes on Tuples

- Tuples are just like lists, but they are immutable.
- Tuples are immutable sequences, typically used to store collections of heterogeneous data.
- Tuples are defined by enclosing the elements in parentheses `()`, separated by commas.

- # Example:
```python
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
print(my_tuple[0]) # Output: 1
print(my_tuple[1]) # Output: 2
print(my_tuple[2]) # Output: 3
```
- # Example of a tuple with mixed data types:
```python
mixed_tuple = (1, "Hello", 3.14, True)
print(mixed_tuple[0]) # Output: 1
print(mixed_tuple[1]) # Output: Hello
print(mixed_tuple[2]) # Output: 3.14
print(mixed_tuple[3]) # Output: True
```
